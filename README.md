# 🛡️ Safeguarding Personal Identity: A Real-Time Deepfake Content Detection Tool  

## 📌 Project Overview  
With the rapid advancement of **deep learning** and **Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)**, deepfake technology has become a serious threat to media authenticity. This project introduces a **real-time deepfake detection system** that can analyze and classify video content as **real or fake**, ensuring the integrity of digital media.  

## 🎯 Objectives  
🔹 **Detect and classify** videos as deepfake or real.  
🔹 Provide a **real-time** deepfake detection tool.  
🔹 Help safeguard individuals from **manipulated synthetic media**.  
🔹 Ensure **media integrity** by preventing the spread of misinformation.  

## 🛠️ Technology Stack  
- **Frontend:** Django (Web-based platform for video uploads)  
- **Backend:** Python (Deep Learning Model)  
- **Deep Learning Frameworks:** PyTorch, TensorFlow  
- **Models Used:**  
  - **ResNext CNN** (Feature Extraction)  
  - **LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory)** (Sequence Processing)  
- **Database:** FaceForensics++, CelebDF datasets  

## 🚀 Features  
✅ **Real-time Deepfake Detection** – Instantly verifies the authenticity of uploaded videos.  
✅ **Robust Feature Extraction** – Uses **ResNext CNN** to detect manipulated features.  
✅ **Sequential Analysis** – Utilizes **LSTM** to capture temporal inconsistencies.  
✅ **Secure and Scalable** – Built using Django for a responsive web-based experience.  
✅ **Confidence Score Display** – Shows accuracy of classification results.  

## 🏗️ Model Architecture  
🔹 **Step 1:** Extract frames from uploaded videos.  
🔹 **Step 2:** Detect and crop faces using **CNN-based face detection**.  
🔹 **Step 3:** Extract feature vectors using **ResNext CNN**.  
🔹 **Step 4:** Process sequential frames using **LSTM network**.  
🔹 **Step 5:** Classify the video as **real or deepfake** based on confidence scores.  

## 📈 Performance Metrics  
- **Accuracy:** Measures the correct classification of real vs fake videos.  
- **Precision & Recall:** Evaluates how well deepfake content is identified.  
- **F1-Score:** Balances precision and recall for optimal performance.  

## 📊 Results  
- Achieved **94.16 accuracy** in real-time deepfake detection.  
- Successfully integrated the model into a **web-based** interface.  
- Detected manipulated facial features with **high precision**.
